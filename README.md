### Important Notes:

- We have tested our theme frontend on Magento 2.4.6-px and 2.4.7-px versions, running on both PHP 8.1 and 8.2. For other versions, any future developments or updates will be announced here as new releases.
- This package is intended for developers who are already familiar with Magento 2 development. Since it is free and open source, we do not provide support for setup-related queries, except for addressing genuine bugs.
- Ensure that your server specifications and cache settings are properly adjusted according to your requirements to achieve the desired optimization in performance and speed.
- While using third-party tracking tools, the score may gradually decrease. Please ensure that you are optimizing them as well.
- The images provided with this theme's frontend are for display purposes only and should not be used on the website for any commercial purposes.
- To maintain the performance score, use web-optimized images.
- Avoid using smaller-dimension images. Ensure the image dimensions are approximately 100-125% of the actual image container.
- Back up the website before installation.



### Demo Server Specs
- High performance is achieved on the shared 4GB RAM AWS Lightsail instance &#x1F4AF;, but this configuration is not advisable for a production environment to handle traffic.
